 * - chute
 * - changer
 * - ramp
 * - copper wire coils with electric current create magnetic field
 * 		- larger coin disturbs field more
 * 		- types of metal disturb field in different ways
 * 	- altered electric current is measured by changer's circuit board
 * 	- diode emits ray of ray + sensor to receive it 2x, blocking light, circuit board measures how long it blocks the light
 *  - retracting gates in sorter then guide coins into respective slots
 *  - passes total via electronic signals to main circuit board
